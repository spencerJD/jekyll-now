Hello! I am currently a postdoc in Soil and Crop Sciences at Cornell University working in Dan Buckley’s lab. All things decomposition, turnover, and growth fascinate me, and find I find beauty in decay. My research focuses on microbial community composition and function in soils and associated with plants in a variety of settings. I’m lucky in that my job consists of walking through the forest all summer, and being elbow deep in sequencing all winter. Can’t beat that!

When I am not in the lab or field, I enjoy hiking, riding/working on motorcycles, LEGO, reading, and knitting. My fiancee does some awesome photography through the microscope, so check out her instagram @under.the.scope!
